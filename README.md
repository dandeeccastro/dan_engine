# Dan Engine
> Chess engine that (regretably) plays like me 

## Description

After watching [someone trying to outsmart Magnus Carlsen by trying to "solve 
chess" writing their own half-assed chess engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNv-FJFGTg)
, I thought to myself *"how could I make an engine that actually helps 
someone to get better at chess?"*. 

**This is the result of that thought.**

It will learn how to play by going through all my previous matches, so it 
can *play as if it were actually me*, so I can play it and learn with
my own mistakes in an unique way. 

## Installation and Usage

Still being defined, I don't know how this will turn out yet.
