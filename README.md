# Dan Engine
> Chess engine that (regretably) plays like me 

## Description

After watching [someone trying to outsmart Magnus Carlsen by making a 
half-assed chess engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNv-FJFGTg), I thought 
to myself *"how could I make an engine that actually helps someone to get 
better at chess?"* This is the result of that thought. 

It will learn how to play by going through all my previous matches, so it 
can play as if it were actually me, and by playing against it, I can learn by
my own mistakes in an outsider's perspective. 

## Installation and Usage

Still being defined, I don't know how this will turn out yet.
